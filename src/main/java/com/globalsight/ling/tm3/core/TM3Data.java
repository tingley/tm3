 * Generic "segment data".  Different implementations may store things

 * <p>
 * The underlying structure may be as simple as a String, or an arbitrarily 
 * complex structure, as long as it is capable of reducing its data to three 
 * forms:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A <b>serialized form</b> for database storage.  This much be a String.
 * The client implementation should also provide a {@link TM3DataFactory} 
 * implementation capable of deserializing this form into an object instance. 
 * <li>A <b>fingerprint</b>, which is an 8-byte hash (or other value) that 
 * is reasonably unique.  Fingerprints are used for exact match queries.
 * Fingerprint matches will be further verified by comparing the serialized
 * form of the exact match candidate, so the fingerprint need not guarantee
 * complete uniqueness.
 * <li>A <b>token stream</b> for fuzzy match indexing and queries.  Ideally,
 * this should be a stream of word tokens, although any well-defined sequence
 * of tokens should work.  Normalization may be applied to the token in order
 * to improve fuzzy candidate production.
 * </ul>

 * database.
